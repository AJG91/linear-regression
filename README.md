# Linear regression

This repository contains code that demonstrates how to apply linear regression to a polynomial using Scikit-learn and PyTorch. As an example, I use a projectile motion example.

## Getting Started

* This project relies on `python=3.12`. It was not tested with different versions.
  To view the entire list of required packages, see `requirements.txt`.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Once you have `cd` into this repo, create a virtual environment (assuming you have `conda` installed) via
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
* Enter the virtual environment with `conda activate linear-regression-env`
* Install the packages in the repo root directory using `pip install -e .`
  (you only need the `-e` option if you intend to edit the source code in `linear-regression/`).


## Example

See https://AJG91.github.io/blog/2025/08/16/projectile-motion.html for an example on how to use this code.
